# Minimum Operations
> `question` In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.
>
> `my understand` - you are only allowed to perform read or write operations on the file, the file will contain a single character H, the end goal is n Hs (n number of character(s))
> 
> `dynamic programming` - is a concept in math and computer science to solve complex problems by breaking it into smaller subproblems, solves them and save their result to avoid doing the same operation and finally build them up all together to solve the complex problem.
> Their are two types of approach to dynamic programming `top-down approach` and `bottom-up approach`
